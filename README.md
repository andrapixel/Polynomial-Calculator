# Polynomial-Calculator


### About

This project consists of a <b>Desktop Application</b> developed in <b>Java Swing</b>, which provides a polynomial calculator with a dedicated graphical user interface through which the user can insert two polynomials, select the desired mathematical operation (i.e., addition, subtraction, multiplication, derivative, integration) to be performed on the input polynomials and view the result.

The source code is structured using the <b>Model View Controller</b> design pattern.

For the extraction of the polynomial coefficients, <b>regular expressions</b> and <b>pattern matching</b> were used.

The application also includes <b>JUnit tests</b> that offer a faster and easier way of proving the accuracy of the results.

<i>For additional information regarding the implementation, a documentation is provided in the `doc` section.</i>



### Further Improvements
* The division operation has yet to be implemented.
